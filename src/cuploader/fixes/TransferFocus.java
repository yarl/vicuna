/**
 * Some components treat tabulator (TAB key) in their own way.
 * Sometimes the tabulator is supposed to simply transfer the focus
 * to the next focusable component.
 * <br/>
 * Here s how to use this class to override the "component's default"
 * behavior:
 * <pre>
 * JTextArea  area  = new JTextArea(..);
 * <b>TransferFocus.patch( area );</b>
 * </pre>
 * This should do the trick. 
 * This time the KeyStrokes are used.
 * More elegant solution than TabTransfersFocus().
