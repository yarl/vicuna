_ultimate tool for upload files to Wikimedia Commons and other Wikimedia projects_

## Usage
For manual, take a look at [project wiki](https://github.com/yarl/vicuna/wiki) and [website](https://yarl.github.io/vicuna).

## Build and Run
Program is being written using any IDE (NetBeans preferred) you want and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is used for building. Minimal version is Java 11. In order to download and build source code, do following:

```
git clone https://github.com/yarl/vicuna.git
cd vicuna
./gradlew build
```
You will find distribution tar and zip `build/distributions` directory.

```
cd build/distributions/
unzip vicuna.zip
./vicuna/bin/vicuna
```

If you want to just run local build:

```
./gradlew run
```

Create org-wikipedia-Wiki.jar file (be careful, we need class file in Java 11 version):
```
git clone https://github.com/MER-C/wiki-java.git
cd wiki-java
mkdir -p org-wikipedia-Wiki/org/wikipedia
cp src/org/wikipedia/Wiki.java org-wikipedia-Wiki/org/wikipedia/
javac org-wikipedia-Wiki/org/wikipedia/Wiki.java
jar cfv org-wikipedia-Wiki-`git rev-parse --verify HEAD --short=6`.jar -C org-wikipedia-Wiki/ .
```

Feel free to fork and suggest changes. However, please do not send pull requests with radical changes without prior discussion. Also, changes should work on NetBeans (especially project building and Form Designer).
